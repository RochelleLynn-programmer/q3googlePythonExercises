# q3googlePythonExercises
The 3 directories in this repo hold the solutions to assessments I completed in the 3rd quarter of the year I was at Kenzie

https://developers.google.com/edu/python

You can find more information about the exersices at the bottom left of the preceding link. 

These 3 assessments were used as practice with python. 

The only one that has a requirements.txt is the log_puzzle because it uses urllib.
